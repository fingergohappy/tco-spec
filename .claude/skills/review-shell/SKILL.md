# review-shell

Review code from a shell script quality perspective.

## Review Scope

Focus on all `.sh` files. Does not review markdown content or architecture design.

## Checklist

### Variable Safety [HIGH]

- Are variables double-quoted: `"$VAR"` instead of `$VAR`
- Is path concatenation safe: `"${dir}/${file}"` instead of `$dir/$file`
- Are command substitutions quoted: `"$(command)"` instead of `$(command)`
- Are there variables used without being declared

### Error Handling [HIGH]

- Does the script start with `set -euo pipefail` or equivalent error handling strategy
- Do piped commands account for intermediate failures (`pipefail`)
- Are exit codes checked after critical commands
- Are temp files created with `mktemp` cleaned up via `trap`

### Command Injection [CRITICAL]

- Is user input or external data directly concatenated into command strings
- Is `eval` usage safe
- Does `xargs` handle special characters (spaces, quotes)

### Portability [MEDIUM]

- Is the shebang explicit: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` or `#!/bin/bash`
- Is bash-specific syntax used while the shebang says `sh`
- Is the `local` keyword used inside functions
- Is array syntax compatible with the target shell

### Readability [LOW]

- Are long pipelines broken with `\`
- Is complex logic extracted into functions
- Are magic numbers or hardcoded paths extracted as variables

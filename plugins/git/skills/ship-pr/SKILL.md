# ship-pr

Take the current feature branch from "work is done" to "PR is open", and — if the user says so — keep watching until CI decides, merging on green and coming back to them on red.

> **Result**: a PR open against the default branch, and either merged, or stopped at a named failing check.

## Phase 1 — Sync

Do everything the `sync-main` skill does: resolve the real branch names, refuse on a dirty tree or an in-progress merge, **work out whether this repo merges or rebases** (its Phase 1 — don't assume either), fetch, integrate `origin/<default>`, stop on conflict.

**A conflict ends this skill.** Don't push a branch mid-conflict and don't open a PR "to see what CI says" — report the conflict and stop, exactly as `sync-main` would.

If the branch was already up to date, that's fine, carry on to Phase 2 — there is still something to ship.

If Phase 1 landed on rebase and the branch was previously pushed, the Phase 2 push needs `--force-with-lease`. Know that before you get there.

## Phase 2 — Push

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD          # first push of this branch
git push                         # subsequent
```

If the push is rejected as non-fast-forward, someone else moved the branch. **Stop.** Do not `--force`. Report what diverged and let the user decide.

If Phase 1 rebased, the push needs `--force-with-lease`, never plain `--force` — and only when the rebase is the reason the remote diverged. A non-fast-forward rejection on a branch you did **not** rebase means someone else pushed; that is the case above, and force would destroy their work.

## Phase 3 — Open the PR

First check whether one already exists for this branch:

```sh
gh pr view --json number,url,state,isDraft 2>/dev/null
```

If it exists and is open, **reuse it** — the push in Phase 2 already updated it. Say so instead of trying to create a duplicate.

Otherwise create it:

```sh
gh pr create --base <default> --head <branch> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

- **Title**: derived from the commits this branch adds (`git log --oneline origin/<default>..HEAD`). One commit → its subject. Several → what they add together, written in whatever style the recent history uses — read `git log --oneline -20` and match it (conventional prefixes, gitmoji, bare sentences: each repo differs, don't impose one).
- **Body**: **the project's own template wins.** Look for one in this order, and stop at the first hit:
  1. **`.github/pull_request_template.md`**, or a file under `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` — the standard location, and the one GitHub's own web UI serves, so it is what this repo's humans already see
  2. a template named by the project's agent conventions (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — grep them for `pr` / `template`), for a repo that deliberately keeps it elsewhere
  3. anything matching `docs/**/pr-template*.md` or `docs/**/pull-request*.md`

  **Fill it out** — don't ignore it, don't paste it back empty, don't reorder or drop its sections, and don't append a structure of your own next to it. A section that doesn't apply keeps its heading with `None` in the body (or whatever that template says to write). Templates written for this job usually carry their own instructions in an HTML comment at the top — follow those, then strip every comment and unreplaced placeholder before posting.

  Only if there is no template anywhere: what changed and why, then the commit list, plus the ops section below.
- **Language**: match the existing PRs (`gh pr list --limit 10 --json title,body`). Don't switch the repo to another language.
- `--draft` if the user passed it.

### The ops section is not optional

A PR body that only describes code leaves whoever deploys it to find out at deploy time that it needs a variable nobody set. **Work these out from the diff** — don't ask the user to recall them, and never write "none" without having looked.

**If the project's template already covers this** — it has its own sections for migrations, env vars, runtime settings, verification — then fill *those* and do not add a second "Ops" heading beside them. The template's version is usually sharper than the generic table below, because it names this project's own hazards. The table is the fallback for a repo with no template, and a checklist for reading one: if the template has no row for something the diff needs, that item still has to reach the body somewhere.

```sh
git diff origin/<default>...HEAD --stat
git diff origin/<default>...HEAD --diff-filter=A --name-only    # added files: migrations and seeds land here
```

At minimum, check for each of these:

| What | How to find it | What the PR must say |
|---|---|---|
| **New env var / config key** | new reads in the diff (`os.Getenv`, `process.env.`, `getenv`, `ENV[`), new lines in `.env.example` / `.env.sample` / chart values | name, whether it has a default, what breaks if unset, suggested production value |
| **Migration** | added files under the project's migration directory | file/version, what it does, whether it locks, whether `down` is safe |
| **Seed / backfill SQL** | added `.sql` containing `INSERT`/`UPDATE`, new scripts under `scripts/`, `db/seeds/` | when to run it (after migrate? before cutover?), whether it is idempotent, what a second run does |
| **New dependency or external service** | `go.mod` / `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `Cargo.toml` diffs; new API hosts, queues, cron entries, buckets | what must be provisioned, which credentials, which network access |
| **Feature flag** | new flag and its default | on or off at deploy, who flips it, how to roll back |
| **Order between the above** | more than one of the rows above | the explicit sequence |

Write it as a checklist, so the person deploying can tick items off:

```markdown
## Ops

- [ ] **Env** `PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` — no default; the service fails to start without it. Production: 3000
- [ ] **Migration** `000075_add_refund_idx.up.sql` — creates an index CONCURRENTLY, no table lock
- [ ] **Seed** `scripts/seed_refund_reasons.sql` — idempotent; run after the migration, before the flag is on
- [ ] **Order**: migrate → roll containers → seed → enable `refund_v2`
```

If the diff genuinely needs no ops work, say **"Ops: none"** explicitly. A missing section reads as "nobody thought about it"; an explicit "none" reads as "checked, nothing needed".

If the project keeps a deployment checklist for this change elsewhere, take the items from there rather than re-deriving them — a repo on the sdd workflow accumulates them in `docs/sdd/work/CR-NNN-*/release.md` while the code is being written — that file is a **copy of this project's own PR template**, filled in section by section as each step lands, so facts like "the previous binary cannot run on the new schema" and the actual last line of a verification command are recorded at the moment they are known. When it exists and its headings match the template, it is the body: check it against the template (a template can change mid-CR), strip the comments, post it. Still put them in the PR body: the reviewer and the deployer read the PR, not that file.

Report the PR URL as soon as it exists. That is the deliverable; everything after this point is optional.

## Phase 4 — Ask before touching the merge

Ask the user, in one line: **auto-accept this PR?** Explain what it means in the same breath — wait for CI, merge on green, come back on red.

Do not proceed to Phase 5 without an explicit yes. If the user says no (or passed `--no-merge`), stop here: the PR is open, the URL is reported, done.

## Phase 5 — Watch CI

Look once before waiting:

```sh
gh pr checks <number>
```

Three cases:

- **No checks configured** — nothing to wait for. Tell the user there is no CI on this PR and ask whether to merge anyway. Don't silently treat "no checks" as "green".
- **All finished** — go straight to Phase 6.
- **Still running** — wait, but not in the foreground:

```sh
gh pr checks <number> --watch --fail-fast     # run this in the background
```

CI runs routinely take longer than a foreground command may last. Start the watch in the background and let its completion wake you; do not sit in a `sleep`/poll loop burning turns, and do not shorten the wait by declaring a result the checks haven't reached.

While waiting, report that you are waiting and roughly what for (`3 checks running: ci / build / lint`).

## Phase 6 — Green merges, red asks

**Green** (`gh pr checks` exits 0 / every required check passed) — merge it the way this repo merges PRs. That is a different question from Phase 1's, and it has its own answer:

```sh
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{merge:.allow_merge_commit, squash:.allow_squash_merge, rebase:.allow_rebase_merge}'
```

1. **Only one allowed** — use it. The others are switched off on purpose.
2. **Several allowed** — read the history: `Merge pull request #NN from …` commits mean merge commits; a linear `<default>` where each PR landed as exactly one commit means squash.
3. **Still ambiguous** — ask. Squashing a repo that keeps merge commits throws away authorship granularity that nobody can get back.

```sh
gh pr merge <number> --merge|--squash|--rebase --delete-branch
git checkout <default> && git pull
```

If the merge is refused — branch protection, required review, out-of-date base — report the exact refusal and stop. That refusal is a rule someone set on purpose; it is not an obstacle to route around.

**Red**: stop and bring it back to the user with enough to act on:

- which check failed, and its URL
- the failing step's output — the actual error lines, not "the build failed" (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`, trimmed to what matters)
- whether it looks related to this branch's changes or pre-existing on `<default>`
- the PR is left open and unmerged

Then ask what they want: fix and re-push, merge anyway, or leave it.

Never merge a red PR without being told to in that exact situation, and never re-run CI hoping for a different answer without saying that's what you're doing.

## Report

1. sync result — merged or rebased (and how that was decided), commits integrated, or already up to date
2. PR — URL, created or reused
3. CI — checks run and their verdicts, or that the user declined the watch
4. merge — merged and back on `<default>`, or why not
